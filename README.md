A Spectrum acquisition, manipulation and analysis program suite

This program suite is conceived as an open-source solution to help the analysis and manipulation of spectral datasets, 
in particular UV/vis absorption, fluorescence and FTIR data, that I use but should be easily extensible to other 
types of scientific data.
The need for this program suite is I feel because of the poor quality and lack of flexibility in existing spectral data
handling programs as found on various different types of instrument. Often excellent instruments are rendered almost
useless by bad data manipulation programs hiding behind proprietry data formats etc.

Using Python for the interface I hope to create a program that can be run as a stand alone program with a graphical user interface, and a package that can be used in python to facilitate spectral manipulation and analysis in a batch mode.
