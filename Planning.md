# PySpec program development
## My personal notes for the development...

Priorities etc.

## Need to set up and learn: 
- eric IDE, 
- matplotlib (manual 2000 pages), 
- Qt5, and 
- Python...
- Will probably need to learn how to move some things to C++
A steep learning curve in prospect.

## Things that should be done
### Version 0.0 a minimal functional viewer
For a first version to pull into the master branch:
Current todo list:
- [x] Avoid concatenation of datasets.
- [x] Handle file dialog cancel.
- [x] Edit, Save, SaveAs, and Open buttons on user interface.
- [x] Save and SaveAs functionality (different formats)
- [x] Handle file parsing problems and other error handling
- [x] Form for spectrum properties to allow creation of PySpec format
- [x] Remove leading dot from dataset.filetype
- [x] Abstractions of current objects Dataset, Window, App
- [x] Documentation of program

### Version 0.1 or later
Things todo and to add later as and when we advance
- [ ] Parsers for different commonly found file formats and own file format.
- [ ] Test dataset.filetype for read and save
- [ ] Documentation pydoc and doxygen and Github wiki
- [ ] Add program menu File and Info for starters
- [ ] Load and display multiple spectra
